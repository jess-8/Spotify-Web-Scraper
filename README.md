## General Info
This project is a simple web scraper that returns an excel table of the Top 20 Spotify songs (listing rank, artist name, song title, number of streams, and each artist's five most popular songs) and a bar graph of each Top 20 song and number of streams. I used this project to learn how to use BeautifulSoup and develop my web-scraping skills.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* VS Code 1.74
* Python 3.11
* BeautifulSoup 4.11
